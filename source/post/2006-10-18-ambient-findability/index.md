I'm finishing up reading the book '[Ambient Findability](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0596007655/findability-20/)' from Peter Morville which is mind bending for me. The subtitle is very catchy and true: "What we find changes who we become". The book is a journey into the aspects of findability, ranging from search strategies on the web to how human kind built maps to know the world they live in. It is a great book for everyone who wants to get a deeper knowledge on what social software, tagging, folksonomies and other web 2.0 catch phrases actually mean and how they have the potential to change the way we think about how we categorize objects in our world.
