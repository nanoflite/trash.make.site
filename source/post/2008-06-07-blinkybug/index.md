[![blinkybug_2](images/blinkybug_2.jpg)](https://vandenbran.de/?attachment_id=92)I made a [blinkybug](http://www.blinkybug.com/) today together with my daughter of 5. It is the first time she handled a soldering iron, but everything went well. We're both very happy with the result and the little creature can live in her bedroom.
