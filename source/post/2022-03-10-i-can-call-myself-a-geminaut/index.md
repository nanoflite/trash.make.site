In my quest to tech minimalism I'm exploring new ways to get rid of large bloated sites and to move away from a web where there's no more information but only infotainment and sponsored articles. Gemini is a rather new alternative to the WWW that embraces a minimal approach without sacrificing security and information density. It emphases content over form and liberates us from the ever expanding HTML/CSS/Javascript tech stack.

This means that you can reach this site over the gemini protocol as well. Point your gemini browser to [gemini://vandenbran.de/](gemini://vandenbran.de/).
