It has been more than three years since I posted my last entry on this (blog) site. I'm not going to explain with a lot of words why this happened, but suffice to say that I got fed-up with creating posts using Wordpress. 

Don't understand me wrong, I love Wordpress, I've been a user of Wordpress for a long time, and I really like it a lot. I even did some consultancy on Wordpress, creating custom web apps with it, wrote some plugins for customers, etc...
But for me the friction to put something online is just too big. I live in the shell or my IDE, and I just want to be able to put something online without having to log in to a CMS, keeping it up-to-date etc ...

I know, there are static site generators, but I just could not get myself to invest time into yet another piece of technology that abstracts away the real stuff.
What will you learn when using a CMS or a static site generator? Will you learn about the protocols and formats that power the Web, or will you just be learning and wrapping your head around how the creators of the tool think you should build a website or a blog?

I think it is time to go back to basics.

Inspired by sites like the [solar powered version of LowTech magazine](https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/), [RawText.Club](https://rawtext.club/), I tried to create my own site which is not very resource hungry and goes back to basics.
This way I get more bang-for-the-buck as they say. I (re)learn the basics of the protocols and standards involved (HTTP, HTML, CSS), I get to write some Python code, and it's just fun.
