Johan Van den Brande is an electronics engineer (MSc) who thought it would be better to pursue a career in software instead of hardware. Having worked for a big player in the storage industry, Johan now finds a daily challenge in running his own consultancy business. [Find my C.V. here...](http://careers.stackoverflow.com/johanvdb)

Next to his career he tries to be a loving husband and a good father to three children.

He lives in a small village in Belgium, Tongerlo, which has its own [abbey](http://www.tongerlo.org/), an abundance of social life (look [here](http://www.tongerloleeft.be/), [here](http://www.hsvtongerlo.be/), [here](http://www.kfctongerlo.be/), and [here](http://www.google.be/search?hl=nl&q=tongerlo&btnG=Zoeken&meta=)) and its own local [beer](http://www.tongerlo.be/).

Johan finds satisfaction in tinkering, toying, fiddling and experimenting with both emerging and heirloom technologies. He has a small prototyping lab where he puts together contraptions of all sorts and the occasional customer project.

To stay healthy, Johan trains for track and field at [AC Westerlo](http://www.acwesterlo.be/) and participates in trail runs in search for his limits.

He also is an avid [discus launched glider](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discus_Launch_Glider) pilot at competition level.

Oh, and did he mention he loves to write in the third person about himself?
