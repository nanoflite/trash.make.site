Hi! My name is Johan Van den Brande, and I'm a self-employed software engineer from Belgium. Welcome to my website!

From time to time I make something and write about it, sometimes I don't, sometimes I just write about something.

If you want to know more about me...

   * you can send me an email at johan@vandenbrande.com ([mailto](mailto:johan@vandenbrande.com))
   * or look at my projects on github 
   * or just take a look around this site.

Know that this site does not uses cookies, so there's no being afraid for being tracked. I do keep serverlogs.
