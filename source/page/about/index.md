Hi! My name is Johan Van den Brande, and I'm a self-employed software engineer from Belgium.
I'm a product from the early seventies of the previous millennium, happily married and a father of 3 children.
Welcome to my website!

From time to time I make something and write about it, sometimes I don't, sometimes I just write about something.

If you want to know more about me...

   * You can email me at johan@vandenbrande.com ([mailto](mailto:johan@vandenbrande.com)).
   * You can take a look at my projects on github ([github](https://nanoflite.itch.io/)).
   * You can take a look at some of my (retro) games on itchio.io ([itch.io](https://nanoflite.itch.io/)).  
   * You can just take a look around this site.

Know that this site does not use cookies, so there's no being afraid for being tracked. I do keep server logs.
